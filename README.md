##SpentWise
spend wise, live wise!!!
We are going through an era of education where education is not optional for any kid. While schools are teaching kids science, maths, English, computer science etc, no one is teaching kids the one skill that actually will help kids in real life. that skill is how to spend wisely and make a living with very little money. While it's important to gain skills in coding, banking, etc. It's also important to know, how do you survive with less money, how do you make decisions that would benefit you in the long term.

We have build a game to teach kids the same. In this game, kids will have the choice of choosing one of several career paths and they will have to survive with the given job for a month. Each career path has its own pros and cons. If the kid survived in the game for a month they win!!!
